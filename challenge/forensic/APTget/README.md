**Description :**
As a company that does threat hunting everyday, we stumble upon reports that mention about active malware campaign apparently targeting Malaysia. After an initial assessment we decided to investigate further, unfortunaley our top analyst is on sick leave for the week, we need you to investigate this further and get to find out who is the real threat actor behind this campaign fast enough before our competitors because it is important for our company to get all the fame and credits.

Good luck!

p/s: if you can find out who behind this, it will be awesome to see the writeup!
